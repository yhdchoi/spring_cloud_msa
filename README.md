## Architecture

> For this project, I am demonstrating
>
a [Microservice Architecture](https://yhdchoi.notion.site/Microservice-Architecture-1d40b6ddbce580cdb8cfe3bcc877912b?pvs=4)
> with
>
an [Event-Driven Architecture](https://yhdchoi.notion.site/Event-Driven-Architecture-1d40b6ddbce580f1a39fe756daf040d2?pvs=4).
> MSA and EDA has become an industry standard due to its collection of loosely coupled services that operate together
> which can be modified, scaled, tested and deployed.
> With Event-Driven services, you can allow data transmission in real-time through asynchronous events.

## Getting Started

To run the project you will need Docker. You need to run the docker compose file within the Config Server first when
starting the project for the first time since the docker-compose.yml contains all the necessary containers to run the
application.

> ❗️IMPORTANT: This project is set up so that you can run on local environment as a demonstrations ONLY.

## Environment

### Container - Docker + Jib




### Orchestration - Kubernetes

> Kubernetes is a platform for managing containers, which bundle the code, configuration, and dependencies of an
> application,
> allowing it to run as an isolated process with its own resources. Each application gets its own container or multiple
> containers,
> which are grouped into Kubernetes pods.

## Build the Microservices

> Run the following command to build and package each of the microservices into docker

```shell

```
